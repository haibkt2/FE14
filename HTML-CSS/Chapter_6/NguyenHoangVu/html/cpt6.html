            <p> What's 75 million years old and <br>
                brand spanking new? A teenage <br>
                Utahceratops! Come to the <br>
                Saroyan, armed with your best <br>
                dinosaur roar, When Scott <br>
                Sampson, Research Curator at the <br>
                Utah Museum of Natural History,<br>
                steps to the podium. Sampson's <br>
                research has focused on the <br>
                ecology and evolution of late <br>
                Creatceous dinosaurs and he has <br>
                conducted fieldwork in a number of <br>
                countries in Africa. <br>
                <br>
                Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. <br>
                in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on <br>
                two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late <br>
                Creatceous of Montana, as well as the grownth and function of certopsid <br>
                horns and frills.
                <br>
                Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the <br>
                American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by five <br>
                years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of <br>
                Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah <br>
                accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of <br>
                Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the <br>
                Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve <br>
                around the phylogenetics, functional morphology and evolution of Late <br>
                Creatceous dinosaurs.
                <br>
                In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has <br>
                conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and <br>
                Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the <br>
                on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently <br>
                compeleted a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, <br>
                which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their <br>
                worlds to date.
